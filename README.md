# Azure Data Factories

Data Set for example: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?accessType=open&tags=NXBNqbCUPNOBzgZYNeH6x  Restaurant Orders .

# Goal

1. Creation of a pipeline to merge multiple files with the same structure: This pipeline will enable the merging of data from different files into a single file for further processing.
2. Storing data in storage and a SQL database: We plan to save the merged data in Azure storage and transfer it for storage and processing in a SQL database.
3. Development of a pipeline to transform files in Azure Data Factory: Creating this pipeline in Azure Data Factory will facilitate the process of transforming data from files and saving the obtained results in the database for further use.
